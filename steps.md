1. Create failing test case
  * Gemfile
  * Rakefile
  * Add test case
2. Writing failing acceptance test
  * Rename file
  * include rack test methods
  * Note about test naming
    - Not sure what to call it. Just use a place holder for now. The
      goal of the test is not the name, but to provide direction.
  * Test fails because app is not defined
